``` python
# Question 0
your answer to the question

6. Write a one-line statement that will convert the tuple from question 1 into a list and print it.

7. Write a one-line statement that will combine the tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)` to form one tuple `(4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3)` and print it.

8. Write a one-line statement that will repeat create a tuple of 5 `a`'s using repetition and print it.
